# User_Auth
Simple Rails User Authentication App

This is a simple User Authentication app that simply has the ability to Signup as a new user, Login In and Edit the user. It also has the ability to add a role to a user. A user can either be an admin or a simple user. If the role is admin, a user can edit and destroy a user. Simple users cannot edit or destroy users.

In the seeds.rb there are two default users. One is an admin and the other is a basic user.
